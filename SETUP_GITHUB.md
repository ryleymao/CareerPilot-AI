# GitHub Setup Guide

## Quick Steps to Push to GitHub

### 1. Create Repository on GitHub

Go to https://github.com/new and create a new repository:

- **Repository name**: `jobright-clone`
- **Description**: `Open-source JobRight.ai alternative with AI-powered resume matching, tailoring, and job scraping`
- **Visibility**: ‚úÖ Public (so others can use it)
- **Do NOT** check "Initialize with README" (we already have one)

Click **Create repository**

### 2. Push Code to GitHub

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/ryleymao/jobright-clone

# Add GitHub as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/ryleymao/jobright-clone.git

# Push code
git push -u origin main
```

That's it! Your code will be live at:
**https://github.com/ryleymao/jobright-clone**

### 3. Add Your API Key (Don't commit it!)

After pushing to GitHub, add your Anthropic API key locally:

```bash
# Edit the .env file
nano backend/.env

# Add your key:
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here

# Or use OpenAI instead:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key-here
```

**Important**: The `.env` file is in `.gitignore`, so your API key will NOT be pushed to GitHub.

### 4. Add Topics to Your Repo (Optional but Recommended)

On your GitHub repository page, click "‚öôÔ∏è Settings" ‚Üí "Topics" and add:
- `job-search`
- `resume-matching`
- `ai`
- `fastapi`
- `docker`
- `python`
- `resume-parser`
- `job-scraping`
- `machine-learning`
- `nlp`

This helps people discover your project!

### 5. Enable GitHub Issues and Discussions

In Settings:
- ‚úÖ Enable Issues (for bug reports/feature requests)
- ‚úÖ Enable Discussions (for community Q&A)

## Sharing Your Project

### Add Badges to README (Optional)
